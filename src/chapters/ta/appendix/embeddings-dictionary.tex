    # Standards
    "erc-20": "The standard for fungible tokens, representing interchangeable assets. Requires functions like transfer, approve, and balanceOf",
    "erc-721": "The standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), representing unique assets. Requires functions like ownerOf and safeTransferFrom",
    "erc-721a": "An optimized version of ERC-721 for significantly cheaper gas costs when minting multiple NFTs in a single transaction",
    "erc-1155": "A multi-token standard that can manage fungible, non-fungible, and semi-fungible tokens in a single contract",
    "erc-4626": "The Tokenized Vault standard. Provides a standard API for yield-bearing vaults that use a single underlying ERC-20 token",
    "erc-2981": "The NFT Royalty Standard. Provides a universal way to retrieve royalty payment information for an NFT",
    "erc-6551": "The Token Bound Accounts standard. Allows every NFT to own its own smart contract wallet, enabling it to hold assets and interact with dApps",
    "eip-712": "The standard for hashing and signing typed structured data, allowing for human-readable messages in wallets",
    "erc-165": "The Standard Interface Detection. Allows contracts to publish the interfaces they support",
    "eip-1967": "The Standard Proxy Storage Slots. Defines specific storage slots to store the logic address and admin address for transparent and UUPS proxies",
    "eip-1822": "The Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard (UUPS). The standard that defines the UUPS upgradeable proxy pattern",
    "eip-2535": "The Diamond Standard. A modular smart contract system where a proxy delegates calls to multiple implementation contracts (facets)",
    "eip-2771": "The Secure Gasless Transactions standard. A system for accepting transactions where a third-party forwarder pays for gas on behalf of the user",
    "erc-4337": "The Account Abstraction standard. Allows for smart contract wallets with advanced features, executed via a decentralized mempool of UserOperations",
    # Design Patterns
    "proxy_transparent": "An upgradeable proxy pattern where logic for admins and users is separated into the proxy contract to avoid function selector clashes",
    "proxy_uups": "An upgradeable proxy pattern (EIP-1822) where the upgrade logic resides in the implementation contract itself, saving deployment gas",
    "diamond": "A modular contract composed of a proxy delegating calls to multiple facet implementation contracts, allowing for granular upgrades",
    "factory": "A contract whose primary purpose is to deploy other clone contracts, often using create or create2",
    "singleton": "A single, unique instance of a contract that serves as a shared resource or registry for an entire protocol",
    "access_control_ownable": "A simple permission model where a single owner address has special privileges, typically via onlyOwner modifiers",
    "access_control_role_based": "A complex permission model where different addresses are assigned specific roles with different rights",
    "reentrancy_guard": "A mechanism, typically a modifier (nonReentrant), to prevent a contract from being called again before its initial function call is complete",
    "checks_effects_interactions": "A code-structuring pattern where state variable checks are performed first, followed by updates to state (effects), and finally calls to external contracts (interactions)",
    "pull_over_push_withdrawal": "A pattern for handling withdrawals where users must call a withdraw function to pull funds, rather than the contract pushing funds to them, to mitigate certain security risks",
    "timelock": "A mechanism that enforces a mandatory delay between when an action is proposed and when it can be executed",
    "library": "A stateless contract containing reusable code that is called via DELEGATECALL by other contracts to save gas and avoid code duplication",
    "commit_reveal": "A two-step process to prevent front-running where a user first submits a hash of their action (commit) and later submits the action itself (reveal)",
    # Functionalities

    "token_minting": "Contains logic for creating new tokens",
    "token_burning": "Contains logic for destroying existing tokens",
    "pausable": "Contains logic to pause and unpause contract functions, halting activity",
    "upgradable": "Contains logic to change the contract's implementation code, typically via a proxy",
    "signature_verification": "Verifies user signatures to authorize actions, often for gasless transactions",
    "staking": "Allows users to lock up assets to earn rewards",
    "vesting": "Locks assets for a period and releases them incrementally over time",

    "data_registry": "Functions as an on-chain key-value store or directory",
    "offchain_data_bridge": "Interacts with an oracle or cross-chain bridge to use external data",
    "randomness": "Consumes a source of on-chain or off-chain randomness (e.g., Chainlink VRF)",
