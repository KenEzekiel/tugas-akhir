	In the midst of widespread Smart Contract adoption, there is a growing need to interact with and reuse existing contracts. Current discovery mechanisms remain largely lexical, anchored in syntactic matches that often fail to capture a contract's functional intent. Several systems have explored ways to describe functionality and intent, but they are not integrated end to end, from extraction through search, and they do not yet leverage modern large language models (LLMs) that can analyze and understand source code.

	In this thesis, we develop a Smart Contract Discovery System based on semantic context. The system is an end-to-end pipeline that extracts Smart Contract data from the Ethereum blockchain, derives semantic descriptions using modern, modular LLMs that can be swapped easily, and indexes the results into a repository that supports semantic search using cosine similarity between query and data embeddings. Our evaluation shows that the system retrieves Smart Contracts that match user intended categories from on chain data and achieves higher precision than text based baselines. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of semantic, LLM assisted discovery for Smart Contracts within the blockchain ecosystem.
