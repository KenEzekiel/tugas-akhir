    In the midst of the growth of Smart Contract data on the blockchain, the need for a discovery system that accommodates reuse is increasing. The adoption of blockchain and the rising number of Smart Contracts in the ecosystem present new challenges. One of the key challenges is reusing existing Smart Contracts that match user requirements. Current Smart Contract discovery systems still rely on keyword-based or text-based search that does not consider the semantic context of the contracts. Thus, users find it difficult to locate suitable Smart Contracts. In this thesis, a semantic context-based Smart Contract Discovery System was developed, leveraging large language models to semantically describe Contract source code and perform retrieval based on semantic similarity. This system utilizes a distributed graph database (Dgraph) to store contract data and embeddings representing the contracts. The system integrates modules for data extraction, enrichment, modeling, and retrieval to improve the relevance of search results. Evaluation results demonstrate that the system increases precision in finding relevant contracts compared to traditional approaches. Therefore, this design demonstrates the effectiveness of using semantic context in Smart Contract discovery within the blockchain ecosystem.
